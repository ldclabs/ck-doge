# ckDOGE: ck-doge-canister
Chain-key Dogecoin (ckDOGE) is an ICRC-2-compliant token that is backed 1:1 by DOGE held 100% on the [ICP](https://internetcomputer.org/).

The `ck-doge-canister` enables other canisters deployed on the Internet Computer to use Dogecoin and interact with the Dogecoin network
